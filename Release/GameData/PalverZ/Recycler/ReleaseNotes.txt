PalverZ Exhaust Recyclers
Parts to make the engine attached below it produce a small amount of mono propellant, look for 
the parts under utilities, after researching fuel systems.

V 0.6.0:
- New Part 2.5M Radial/Inline Collector

V 0.5.0:
- Mechanics only update more parts will come next V (I hope)
- Delete old installs before this one just in case (but should be save safe)
- Secondary resource now a thing defualt is none
- Heat productions of engines is now increased by a cerain precentage this amount is defined in the config, it is not huge.
- Engine types can be defined in the config, right now will only work with one kind, in order to use on multiple types create another module in the config, (for now)
	


V 0.4.0
 **May break saves**: sorry if it does I will do this as few times as possible, should only break ships if anything.
 New part radial/inline collector "RIC" should collect from radial or inline engines, texture a little broken will fix sometime
 Now works with multiple engines attached to the same collector.
 Did small code add that should keep funky things from occurring (not that I think any did)
 
V 0.3.5.0
So exhaust collection rate now depends on the engines thrust as well as the rate using the max thrust of 
the LV-T30 or 215.  configRate*(engineMaxThrust/215).

V 0.3.1.0
Output resource and rate is now configurable defaults to monoprop and 1.5 if those fields are left blank

V 0.2.1.1
Oops Spelling derps although I don't think most people noticed

V 0.2.1.0 
Added Mesh and texture
tweaked the config

V 0.1.3.0
First public release

TODO: 

- Tidy up code
- Make [More] configurable
- Get a real Mesh and texture
- More Parts and sizes (Help welcomed)
- Other stuff?
