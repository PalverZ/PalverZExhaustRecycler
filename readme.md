A part to make the (Liquid Fuel and Oxidizer) engine attached below it produce a small amount of mono propellant, look for 
the part under utilities, after researching fuel systems. Inspired by RoverDudes work with Karbonite Engines

ChangeLog: 

V 0.4.0
 **May break saves**: sorry if it does I will do this as few times as possible, should only break ships if anything.
 New part radial/inline collector "RIC" should collect from radial or inline engines, texture a little broken will fix sometime
 Now works with multiple engines attached to the same collector.
 Did small code add that should keep funky things from occurring (not that I think any did)
 
V 0.3.5.0
So exhaust collection rate now depends on the engines thrust as well as the rate using the max thrust of 
the LV-T30 or 215.  configRate*(engineMaxThrust/215).

V 0.3.1.0
Output resource and rate is now configurable defaults to monoprop and 1.5 if those fields are left blank

V 0.2.1.1
Oops Spelling derps although I don't think most people noticed

V 0.2.1.0 
Added Mesh and texture
tweaked the config

V 0.1.3.0
First public release

TODO: 

- Tidy up code
- Make [More] configurable
- Get a real Mesh and texture
- More Parts and sizes (Help welcomed)
- Other stuff?
